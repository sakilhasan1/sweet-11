                <h1 className='text-primary'>2. What is JWT, and how does it work?</h1>
                <p className='text-success'>JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share security information <br />
                    between two parties â€” a client and a server. Each JWT contains encoded JSON objects, <br />
                    including a set of claims. JWTs are signed using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure that the claims cannot be altered after the token is issued.
                </p>
                <p className='text-success'>
                    A JWT is a mechanism to verify the owner of some JSON data. It's an encoded, URL-safe string that can contain an unlimited <br />
                    amount of data (unlike a cookie) and is cryptographically signed. When a server receives a JWT, it can guarantee the data it contains can be trusted because it's signed by the source.

                <h1 className='text-primary'>3. What is the difference between javascript and NodeJS?</h1>
                <p className='text-success'>
                    JavaScript is a simple programming language that can be used with any <br />
                    browser that has the JavaScript Engine installed. Node. js, on the other hand, is an interpreter or execution environment for the JavaScript programming language

            <div>
                <h1 className='text-primary'>4. How does NodeJS handle multiple requests at the same time?</h1>
                <p className='text-success'>
                    NodeJS receives multiple client requests and places them into EventQueue. NodeJS is built with the concept of event-driven architecture. <br />
                    NodeJS has its own EventLoop which is an infinite loop that receives requests and processes them.
